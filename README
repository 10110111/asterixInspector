Modifying the Asterix specification
-----------------------------------

The specification definition AsterixInspector uses to decode files can be modified and extended to your needs.
To provide your own specification of a Asterix category look in the directory asterixSpecification/. 
Specification files in this directory are read during application start. Copy the one which closely resembles 
the one you need to a new file. In the <asterix> tag assign the category number and a version string to 
distinguish your version. Multiple versions for the same category can be specified. The version used for 
decoding is specified in the 'Specification' dialog before loading a data file.
